<h3>Hi there, I'm Siping Shi &#128075;</h3>

I am a postdoctoral fellow with the Department of Computing at The Hong Kong Polytechnic University (PolyU). I obtained my Ph.D. degree in Nov. 2023 from PolyU, supervised by [Prof. Dan Wang](https://www4.comp.polyu.edu.hk/~csdwang/) and collaborated with [Prof. Zhu Han](http://www2.egr.uh.edu/~zhan2/) and [Prof. Yifei Zhu](https://sites.ji.sjtu.edu.cn/yifei-zhu/). Prior to that, I received my M.Sc. degree from the University of Chinese Academy of Sciences (UCAS) in 2017, supervised by [Prof. Cheng-Zhong Xu](https://www.fst.um.edu.mo/personal/czxu/), and my B.E. degree from Sichuan University (SCU) in 2014, all in Computer Science. Earlier before I did my Ph.D., I worked two years at Alibaba Group (China) after UCAS.

I am interested in **Trustworthy distributed AI systems**, focusing on designing *efficient*, *private* and *robust* machine learning systems on distributed environment and resource-constrained edge device, leveraging privacy enhancing technologies (e.g., functional encryption, differential privacy) and robust optimization methods (e.g., distributionally robust optimization). Specific research topics include **federated learning**, **federated analytics**, and **edge computing for large foundation model**.
