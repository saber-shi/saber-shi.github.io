<h3>Hi there, I'm Siping Shi &#127882;</h3>

I am a postdoctoral fellow with the Department of Computing at The Hong Kong Polytechnic University (PolyU). I obtained my Ph.D. degree in Nov. 2023 from PolyU, supervised by [Prof. Dan Wang](https://www4.comp.polyu.edu.hk/~csdwang/). Prior to that, I received my M.Sc. degree from the University of Chinese Academy of Sciences (UCAS) in 2017, supervised by [Prof. Cheng-Zhong Xu](https://www.fst.um.edu.mo/personal/czxu/), and my B.E. degree from Sichuan University (SCU) in 2014, all in Computer Science. Earlier before I did my Ph.D., I worked two years at Alibaba Group (China)  after UCAS.

I am interested in the Trustworthy Distributed Artificial Intelligence (AI) systems, focusing on the aspects of privacy-preserving, robustness and efficiency. I am currently working on the privacy-preserving and efficient video understanding with Vision Foundation Models.
