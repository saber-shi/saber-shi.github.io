**Hi there, I'm Siping Shi**

I am a postdoctoral fellow with the Department of Computing at The Hong Kong Polytechnic University (PolyU). I obtained my Ph.D. degree in Nov. 2023 from PolyU, supervised by [Prof. Dan Wang](https://www4.comp.polyu.edu.hk/~csdwang/). Prior to that, I received my M.Sc. degree from the University of Chinese Academy of Sciences (UCAS) in 2017, supervised by [Prof. Cheng-Zhong Xu](https://www.fst.um.edu.mo/personal/czxu/), and my B.E. degree from Sichuan University (SCU) in 2014, all in Computer Science. Earlier before I did my Ph.D., I worked two years at Alibaba Group (China)  after UCAS.

I am interested in the Distributed Artificial Intelligence (AI) systems, focusing on the aspects of privacy-preserving, robustness and efficiency. Some specific topics include Federated learning, Federated analytics, edge computing, privacy preservation in Federated Learning. I acquired extensive expertise in improving the performance of Federated Learning under noisy environments (i.e., noisy models, noisy data, and noisy labels caused by either malicious attacks or non-malicious noise), by leveraging advanced technologies such as Distributionally Robust Optimization, Functional Encryption, and Differential Privacy. The late part of my Ph.D. studies was focused on privacy-preserving video analytics on edge devices, and we designed efficient privacy protection schemes for video analytics on the resource-constrained edge with policy-based transformation. Now, in my postdoctoral research, I attempted to solve the efficiency and privacy preservation problems that occur during fine-tuning and deploying large vision foundation models on the edge.
