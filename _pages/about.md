**Hi there, I'm Siping Shi**

I am a postdoctoral fellow with the Department of Computing at The Hong Kong Polytechnic University. I obtained my Ph.D. degree in Nov. 2023 from the Hong Kong Polytechnic University (PolyU), supervised by [Prof. Dan Wang](https://www4.comp.polyu.edu.hk/~csdwang/). Prior to that, I received my M.Sc. degree from the University of Chinese Academy of Sciences (UCAS) in 2017, supervised by [Prof. Cheng-Zhong Xu](https://www.fst.um.edu.mo/personal/czxu/), and my B.E. degree from Sichuan University (SCU) in 2014, all in Computer Science. Earlier before I did my Ph.D., I worked at Alibaba (China) for two years after UCAS.
